# WIP
## What is this DIY
This is my first attempt to build a 3DOF tracking device, I mostly use it on MILSIM games, but it can have other applications. I used a sparkfun LSM9DS1 sensor and a Teense 3.2 board.

## Components

- Sparkfun LSM9DS1
- Teensy board (you can probably use a 2+ version)
- Opentrack

## Wires
